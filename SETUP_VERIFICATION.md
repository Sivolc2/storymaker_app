# Setup Verification Report

## ✅ `pnpm dev:clean` Command Verification

**Status: WORKING CORRECTLY**

### What `pnpm dev:clean` does:
1. **Reset Ports**: Kills any existing processes on ports 5173 (frontend) and 8000 (backend)
2. **Start Development Servers**: Launches both frontend and backend in parallel using Turbo

### Test Results:
- ✅ Port reset script works correctly
- ✅ Frontend starts on http://localhost:5173/
- ✅ Backend starts on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- ✅ Database initializes successfully 
- ✅ Virtual environment (.venv) is properly configured
- ✅ All SystemaWriter modules load without errors
- ✅ React Router navigation works
- ✅ CORS configuration allows frontend-backend communication

### Command Output Sample:
```bash
$ pnpm dev:clean

> example-llm-developer-project@1.0.0 dev:clean
> pnpm reset && pnpm dev

> example-llm-developer-project@1.0.0 reset
> ./repo_src/scripts/reset-ports.sh

Checking for processes using ports 5173 (Frontend) and 8000 (Backend)...
No process found using port 5173.
No process found using port 8000.
Ports have been checked and reset if necessary.

> example-llm-developer-project@1.0.0 dev

### Complete User Workflow (7-Step Process):
1. **Concept Input**: User provides story concept with genre, characters, plot beats
2. **Outline Generation**: AI generates chapter-by-chapter outline, user reviews/edits
3. **Worldbuilding**: AI creates character profiles, setting details, user approves
4. **Scene Decomposition**: AI breaks down each chapter into detailed scene plans
5. **Scene Generation**: User selects scenes, provides identifiers, generates narratives
6. **Scene Refinement**: User edits narratives, saves to story, regenerates as needed
7. **Final Assembly & Export**: Review complete story, export as professional Markdown

### Export File Structure:
```markdown
# Story Outline
[User-approved outline content]

---

# Worldbuilding Notes
[Character profiles, setting details, etc.]
