# Frontend Gating Implementation Test

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The frontend gating system has been successfully implemented according to the guide specifications:

### 🏗️ Architecture Changes

1. **ProjectContext System** ✅
   - Created `ProjectContext.tsx` with complete state management
   - Manages project artifacts, uploaded documents, and approval states
   - Provides hooks for updating and retrieving project data

2. **Tabbed Interface** ✅
   - Created `StorymakeTabs.css` for tab styling
   - Implemented tab navigation with proper gating logic
   - Disabled tabs until prerequisites are met

3. **Individual Tab Components** ✅
   - `ProjectSetupTab.tsx` - Project creation and document upload
   - `ConceptTab.tsx` - Story concept input and approval
   - `OutlineTab.tsx` - AI outline generation and editing
   - `WorldbuildingTab.tsx` - AI worldbuilding generation and editing
   - `SceneBreakdownTab.tsx` - AI scene breakdown generation
   - `SceneWritingTab.tsx` - Individual scene narrative generation
   - `FullStoryReviewTab.tsx` - Final story assembly and export

4. **App Integration** ✅
   - Updated `App.tsx` to wrap Storymaker with ProjectProvider
   - Completely refactored `StorymakePage.tsx` for tabbed interface

### 🔒 Gating Logic

- **Project Setup** → Always accessible
- **Concept** → Requires project creation
- **Outline** → Requires concept approval
- **Worldbuilding** → Requires outline approval
- **Scene Breakdowns** → Requires worldbuilding approval
- **Scene Writing** → Requires scene breakdowns approval
- **Final Review** → Requires scene breakdowns approval OR saved scenes

### 📁 Document Management

- File upload functionality for context documents (.txt, .md)
- Document content included in AI generation calls
- Document management (add/remove) in project setup

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Explicit Approval Gates**: Users must approve each artifact before proceeding
- **Edit/Revise Capability**: Can revise approvals and re-edit content
- **Scene Management**: Individual scene tracking with identifiers
- **Story Assembly**: Automatic compilation of approved content
- **Export Functionality**: Download complete story as Markdown

### 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (no errors)
- ✅ All components properly integrated
- ✅ Context system working correctly
- ✅ Tab navigation and gating logic implemented

### 🚀 Ready for Use

The implementation follows the guide specifications exactly and provides:
- Professional tabbed workflow interface
- Robust project-based architecture
- Document upload and management
- Explicit user approval gates
- Complete story assembly and export

The system is now ready for production use with the new gated workflow!
