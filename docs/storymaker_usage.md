# Storymaker Usage Guide (v0.1)

Storymaker is an AI-assisted tool to help you generate structured narratives from your ideas. This guide explains how to use the v0.1 features.

## How to Use

1.  **Navigate to Storymaker:** In the application, find and open the "Storymaker" page.
2.  **Step 1: Input Concept**
    *   In the "Story Concept" text area, provide your initial ideas. Refer to the "Concept Document Checklist" below for what to include.
    *   Click "Generate Outline".
3.  **Step 2: Review & Approve Outline**
    *   The AI will generate a story outline based on your concept.
    *   Review the generated outline. You can make edits directly in the text area if needed.
    *   Click "Approve Outline & Generate Worldbuilding".
4.  **Step 3: Review & Approve Worldbuilding**
    *   The AI will generate worldbuilding details (characters, setting, etc.) based on your concept and the approved outline.
    *   Review and edit as necessary.
    *   Click "Approve Worldbuilding & Generate Scene Breakdowns".
5.  **Step 4: Review & Approve Scene Breakdowns**
    *   The AI will break down each chapter (from the outline) into a series of scenes, detailing goals and key events for each.
    *   Review these breakdowns. Edits are possible but might be simpler to refine prompts for future versions if major changes are needed.
    *   For each scene you want to write, click "Generate Narrative for this Scene". *(Note: v0.1 might generate one scene at a time or require selection).*
6.  **Step 5: Review Scene Narrative**
    *   The AI will generate the narrative text for the selected scene.
    *   Review the generated text.

## Concept Document Checklist

When providing your "Story Concept", try to include the following for best results:

    *   *Examples: Sci-Fi, High Fantasy, Cultivation Novel, Urban Fantasy, Mystery, Thriller.*

    *   *Examples: "Include: chosen one, mentor figure, magical academy. Avoid: love triangles."*

    *   *Examples: "Themes of rebellion against oppression, the price of power, found family."*
