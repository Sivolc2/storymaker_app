Okay, I've analyzed the requests and broken them down into a series of guides, keeping in mind the constraint of ~1000 lines of code changes per guide. Here's an outline of the proposed guides:

**Total Guides: 6**

---

**Guide 1: Core Layout Restructure & Homepage Update**

*   **Objective:** Restructure the main Storymaker page layout for better space utilization and update the application's homepage content.
*   **Features Covered:**
    1.  **Sidebar Layout Change:**
        *   Modify `StorymakerPage.tsx` and `StorymakerLayout.css`.
        *   The left-hand sidebar (`StorymakerLeftPanel`) will be moved to be a top-level element, persistent alongside the main content area (which contains the tab navigation and tab content). This will provide more vertical space for the sidebar.
    2.  **Homepage Content Update:**
        *   Modify `repo_src/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`.
        *   Update the text content to be more focused on creative writing, Storymaker's capabilities, and how to get started with AI-assisted narrative generation.
*   **Rationale:** Establishes the new overall page structure first. Homepage update is a small, independent text change.
*   **Estimated Size:** ~200-350 lines.

**Guide 2: Workflow Streamlining - Optional Artifacts & Warning Removal**

*   **Objective:** Make the story creation workflow more flexible by removing strict prerequisites and simplifying user interactions.
*   **Features Covered:**
    1.  **Remove Prerequisite Warnings:**
        *   Remove the `PrerequisiteWarningModal.tsx` component and its CSS (`Modal.css` if only used by this).
        *   Remove calls to `showPrerequisiteWarning` and related state management from `StorymakerPage.tsx`.
        *   Update tab components (`OutlineTab.tsx`, `WorldbuildingTab.tsx`, etc.) to directly proceed with actions without this modal.
    2.  **Optional Artifacts:**
        *   Modify logic in `StorymakerPage.tsx` (tab navigation/enabling) and individual tab components.
        *   If a preceding artifact (e.g., Outline) is not yet created or approved, subsequent AI generation steps (e.g., Worldbuilding) will treat its input as an empty string or skip related context parts in prompts.
        *   Users can proceed through tabs even if prior steps are not "approved" or filled. The AI calls will adapt to missing information.
*   **Rationale:** These changes significantly alter the core user flow and data handling logic for AI calls.
*   **Estimated Size:** ~400-600 lines.

**Guide 3: Enhanced Left-Hand Sidebar (LHS) & Dynamic Artifact Display**

*   **Objective:** Improve the clarity and responsiveness of the LHS panel in reflecting the status of generated story artifacts.
*   **Features Covered:**
    1.  **Dynamic LHS Updates for Generated Artifacts:**
        *   Ensure `StorymakerLeftPanel.tsx` accurately and dynamically reflects the state of generated artifacts (Concept, Outline, Worldbuilding, Scene Breakdowns) as they are created, updated, or approved.
        *   This involves verifying that `ProjectContext` updates trigger re-renders effectively.
        *   Consider adding visual cues on the LHS for artifact status (e.g., "Generating...", "Draft", "Approved âœ“").
        *   This is an enhancement of the existing LHS functionality rather than adding new items; it's about making its display more live and informative.
*   **Rationale:** Focuses on improving the UX of an existing key navigation element.
*   **Estimated Size:** ~200-400 lines.

**Guide 4: Scene Breakdown Page Enhancements (Non-Interactive UX)**

*   **Objective:** Improve the usability and information provided on the Scene Breakdown tab.
*   **Features Covered:**
    1.  **Structured Scene List Display:**
        *   In `SceneBreakdownTab.tsx`, instead of (or in addition to) just displaying raw Markdown for scene breakdowns, parse the generated content to present a more structured, ordered list of scenes for each chapter (e.g., "Chapter 1 - Scene 1: The Discovery", "Chapter 1 - Scene 2: The Clue").
    2.  **Runtime Estimation:**
        *   Implement logic in `SceneBreakdownTab.tsx` to count the number of identified scenes from the breakdown.
        *   Display an estimated "AI writing time" based on a simple heuristic (e.g., N scenes * Y seconds/scene).
    3.  **Improved Generation Feedback:**
        *   Modify `SceneBreakdownTab.tsx`'s AI generation call (`generateSceneBreakdowns`).
        *   If breakdowns are generated per-chapter by the backend, update the UI to show feedback like "Generating breakdown for Chapter X..." instead of a single global loading spinner, if feasible with current backend logic.
*   **Rationale:** Improves a specific tab's UX without introducing major new interactive components yet.
*   **Estimated Size:** ~300-600 lines.

**Guide 5: Interactive Scene Breakdowns (GUI for Selection)**

*   **Objective:** Make the scene breakdown process interactive, allowing users to easily select scenes for narrative generation.
*   **Features Covered:**
    1.  **GUI for Scene Selection:**
        *   In `SceneBreakdownTab.tsx`, enhance the (now more structured) list of scenes to be selectable.
        *   When a user selects a scene from this list:
            *   Navigate the user to the `SceneWritingTab.tsx`.
            *   Pre-fill the `SceneWritingTab`'s fields (e.g., Scene Identifier, Scene Plan) with the details of the selected scene.
        *   This will likely involve state management changes in `StorymakerPage.tsx` or `ProjectContext.tsx` to pass the selected scene details to `SceneWritingTab.tsx`.
*   **Rationale:** This is a significant UX improvement, making the transition from breakdown to writing seamless. It has complex inter-component dependencies.
*   **Estimated Size:** ~500-900 lines.

**Guide 6: Uploaded Document Management - View/Edit Functionality**

*   **Objective:** Allow users to view and edit the content of text-based documents they've uploaded for context.
*   **Features Covered:**
    1.  **View/Edit Uploaded Documents:**
        *   Create a new component (e.g., `UploadedDocumentEditor.tsx` or a modal).
        *   When a user clicks an "Edit" button next to an uploaded document in `StorymakerLeftPanel.tsx`:
            *   Display its content in a textarea or simple editor.
            *   Allow modifications to the text content.
            *   Save changes back to the `ProjectContext` (updating the specific `UploadedDocument` object).
        *   The `StorymakerPage.tsx` will need to manage the display of this editor/view.
*   **Rationale:** Adds a new distinct piece of functionality for managing user-provided context.
*   **Estimated Size:** ~400-700 lines.

This set of 6 guides breaks down the features into manageable development slices, generally building upon previous ones or addressing distinct areas of the application.
