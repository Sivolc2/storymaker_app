    narrativeMd: string
}

// Enhanced scene details with identification
interface ActiveSceneDetails {

### Backend Integration

#### Story Assembly Logic
```typescript
const assembleFullStoryMarkdown = (): string => {
    let fullMd = "";
    
    // Include outline and worldbuilding
    if (approvedOutline.trim()) {
        fullMd += `# Story Outline\n\n${approvedOutline}\n\n---\n\n`;
    }
    if (approvedWorldbuilding.trim()) {
        fullMd += `# Worldbuilding Notes\n\n${approvedWorldbuilding}\n\n---\n\n`;
    }

    // Add narrative section with sorted scenes
    fullMd += `# Full Story Narrative\n\n`;
    
    const sortedStory = [...finalStoryContent].sort((a, b) => {
        if (a.chapterTitle < b.chapterTitle) return -1;
        if (a.chapterTitle > b.chapterTitle) return 1;
        return a.sceneOrderHeuristic - b.sceneOrderHeuristic;
    });
    
    // Group by chapter and concatenate scenes
    let currentChapterForHeader = "";
    sortedStory.forEach(scene => {
        if (scene.chapterTitle !== currentChapterForHeader) {
            fullMd += `## ${scene.chapterTitle}\n\n`;
            currentChapterForHeader = scene.chapterTitle;
        }
        fullMd += `${scene.narrativeMd}\n\n---\n\n`;
    });

    return fullMd;
};
```

#### Export Functionality
```typescript
const handleExportStory = () => {
    const markdownContent = assembleFullStoryMarkdown();
    const blob = new Blob([markdownContent], { type: 'text/markdown;charset=utf-8' });
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
    link.download = 'SystemaWriter_Story.md';
    document.body.appendChild(link);
    link.click();
    document.body.removeChild(link);
    URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href);
};
```

### Styling Enhancements

#### New CSS Features
- **Navigation Cards**: Prominent styling for story assembly access
- **Export Buttons**: Green-themed export functionality with hover effects
- **Assembled Story Preview**: Dark-themed preview with scrollable content
