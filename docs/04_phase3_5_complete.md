## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes (`SystemaWriterPage.tsx`)

#### New State Management
```typescript
type CurrentStep = 
    | 'concept' 
    | 'outline' 
    | 'worldbuilding' 
    | 'scene_breakdowns_display'  // NEW: Displaying all breakdowns
    | 'scene_narrative_setup'     // NEW: Setting up scene generation
    | 'scene_narrative_review'    // NEW: Reviewing/editing scenes

interface ActiveSceneDetails {
    chapterTitle: string
    fullChapterBreakdownMd: string
    scenePlanInput: string // User-provided scene plan
}
```

#### New UI Components
- **Scene Breakdowns Display**: Shows all chapter breakdowns with navigation
- **Scene Narrative Setup**: Guides user through scene selection and plan input
- **Scene Narrative Review**: Provides editing and regeneration capabilities

#### Enhanced User Flow
1. **Scene Breakdowns Display**: User reviews AI-generated breakdowns by chapter
2. **Scene Selection**: User clicks "Work on a scene" for a specific chapter
3. **Scene Plan Input**: User copies specific scene plan from breakdown
4. **Generation**: AI creates narrative based on scene plan and context
5. **Review & Edit**: User can manually edit or regenerate with style notes

### Backend Integration

#### Existing API Endpoints (No Changes Required)
- `POST /api/systemawriter/generate-scene-breakdowns` - Returns structured breakdowns by chapter
- `POST /api/systemawriter/generate-scene-narrative` - Generates narrative for specific scene

#### Data Flow
```
Scene Breakdowns → Chapter Selection → Scene Plan Input → Narrative Generation → Review/Edit
```

### Styling Enhancements (`SystemaWriter.css`)

#### New CSS Features
- **Chapter Breakdown Cards**: Improved visual organization
- **Scene Plan Input**: Specialized styling for scene plan textarea
- **Narrative Editor**: Enhanced textarea for long-form editing
- **Button Groups**: Better organization of action buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes
